## Comparison between Map 1 and Map 2
The difference in maps shown below reference time, specifically a difference of 20 minutes. The specific time in which data was captured for map 1 was 10:14. For map 2 it was 10:34. I wanted to make a comparison of twitter geoactivity in the evening, and at a later time in the evening. In the first map we can noticeably see more dots, which refer to more activity, as more users are tweeting. The second map has less dots, which refer to less activity, as some users are likely sleeping, especially in the east coast.

## Comparison between Word Art 1 and Word Art 2
When comparing the word art images, we can see that the top recurring words for word art 1 are game, play, amp, up, etc. This might refer to people playing games, and talking about hobbies and activities. In word art 2, the top recurring words are mesonet, reports, mph, pm, tonight, etc. These words might refer to late night news broadcasts. Mesonet is a "network of environmental monitoring stations designed to measure the environment at the size and duration of mesoscale weather events" (source google). It makes sense that this topic might occur later into the night, as stations are monitoring weather as users sleep.
